# Search Content Skill

Navigate and search the knowledge base efficiently using AkashicRecords directory governance structure.

## When to use this Skill

- User asks "where is", "find", "search for"
- User queries file locations
- User looks for specific topics or content
- User needs to navigate knowledge base
- User asks "do I have notes about..."

## Workflow

### 1. Analyze Query

**Parse user request**:
- Extract keywords and topics
- Identify search scope (specific directory or entire knowledge base)
- Determine search type (filename, content, topic, date-based)
- Assess query specificity (exact match vs fuzzy search)

**Examples**:
```
"Where are my transformer notes?" â†’ Topic search, keyword: "transformer"
"Find files modified last week" â†’ Date-based search
"Search for 'attention mechanism' in Research" â†’ Content search, scoped to Research/
"List all meeting notes from October" â†’ Category + date search
```

### 2. Choose Search Strategy

Select appropriate strategy based on query:

#### Strategy 1: Structured Navigation (Preferred)
**When to use**:
- Query mentions directory names (Work, Research, Personal, etc.)
- Looking for specific categories or types
- Query has clear organizational clues

**Method**:
- Start at root README.md or specified directory
- Follow directory index structure
- Use README.md files as curated navigation guides
- Narrow down systematically

**Advantages**:
- Fast and efficient
- Leverages existing organization
- Follows curated structure

#### Strategy 2: Pattern Search
**When to use**:
- Looking for filenames matching patterns
- User provides specific naming clues
- Need to find files by naming convention

**Method**:
- Use Glob for filename patterns: `**/*keyword*.md`
- Filter by date if needed: files modified in last N days
- Use multiple patterns for comprehensive search

**Advantages**:
- Direct filename matching
- Fast for filename-based queries
- Good for date-based searches

#### Strategy 3: Deep Content Search
**When to use**:
- Looking for specific text or code within files
- Pattern/structured search insufficient
- Need comprehensive text search

**Method**:
- Use Grep for content search: `grep -r "keyword" .`
- Search within specific file types
- Use Task subagent for complex multi-step searches

**Advantages**:
- Finds content regardless of organization
- Comprehensive coverage
- Good for forgotten file locations

### 3. Execute Search

**Structured Navigation example**:
```
User: "Find my AI research notes"

1. Start at root, read README.md
2. Identify Research/ directory (purpose: "Technical and academic research")
3. Read Research/README.md
4. Find AI/ or DeepLearning/ subdirectories
5. Read Research/AI/README.md
6. List all files in index
7. Filter by relevance
8. Return matching files
```

**Pattern Search example**:
```
User: "Find files about transformers"

1. Use Glob: `**/*transformer*.md`
2. Results:
   - Research/AI/2025-10-28-transformer-architecture.md
   - Research/AI/2025-10-20-transformer-applications.md
   - Work/Projects/transformer-project.md
3. Rank by modification date (most recent first)
4. Return results
```

**Deep Content Search example**:
```
User: "Search for 'attention mechanism'"

1. Use Grep: grep -r "attention mechanism" . --include="*.md"
2. Results (with context):
   - Research/AI/transformer-architecture.md (3 matches)
   - Research/AI/neural-networks.md (1 match)
3. Extract surrounding context for each match
4. Rank by relevance (match count, recency)
5. Return results with context snippets
```

### 4. Check Governance

**For each result**:
1. Check directory RULE.md for read permissions
2. Skip files in restricted directories
3. Note if file requires special access

**Permission check**:
```
RULE.md says: "Restricted access - confidential"
â†’ Skip this file or warn user about restrictions
```

**Privacy considerations**:
- Respect RULE.md access restrictions
- Don't expose content from restricted directories
- Warn if search includes restricted areas

### 5. Rank Results

**Ranking criteria**:
1. **Relevance**: Keyword matches, topic similarity
2. **Recency**: Recently modified files ranked higher
3. **Location**: Files in expected directories ranked higher
4. **Completeness**: README.md-indexed files ranked higher (curated)

**Scoring example**:
```
File A: transformer-architecture.md
- Title match: +50
- Recent (3 days): +30
- In expected directory (Research/AI): +20
- Listed in README: +10
- Total: 110

File B: old-notes.md
- Content match only: +30
- Old (3 months): +5
- In Miscellaneous: +10
- Not in README: +0
- Total: 45

Result order: File A, then File B
```

### 6. Present Results

**Clear result format**:
```
ðŸ“š Search results for "[query]"

Found [X] matches:

1. [filename.md](path/to/file.md) â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜†
   Location: [directory path]
   Last modified: [date]
   Description: [from README.md or first line]
   Match: [Context snippet if content search]

2. [another-file.md](path/to/another.md) â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜†â˜†
   Location: [directory path]
   Last modified: [date]
   Description: [description]
   Match: [Context snippet]

[More results...]

Didn't find what you need?
- Try broader keywords
- Search in specific directory
- Check Archive/ for old content
```

**Include helpful metadata**:
- File location (full path)
- Last modified date
- Brief description from README.md
- Relevance score (stars or percentage)
- Context snippet (for content searches)

### 7. Follow-up Options

**After presenting results**:
```
What would you like to do?
- Read [filename]
- Search within these results
- Refine search with different keywords
- Search in different directory
- Show more results
```

**Interactive refinement**:
- User can narrow down results
- Ask follow-up questions
- Navigate to related files
- Explore directory structure

## Search Strategies in Detail

### Structured Navigation

**Step-by-step process**:
1. Identify starting point (root or specific directory)
2. Read starting README.md
3. Parse directory structure from README.md
4. Match query keywords to directory names/descriptions
5. Descend into most relevant subdirectory
6. Repeat until finding target files
7. List files from README.md index

**Example**:
```
Query: "Find meeting notes from October"

1. Read root README.md
2. Find Work/ directory
3. Read Work/README.md
4. Find Meetings/ subdirectory
5. Read Work/Meetings/README.md
6. Filter entries by date (October)
7. Return matching files
```

**Advantages**:
- Leverages human-curated organization
- Fast and efficient
- Follows logical structure

**Limitations**:
- Requires good README.md maintenance
- May miss files not indexed
- Depends on consistent organization

### Pattern Search

**Glob patterns**:
```
**/*keyword*.md           â†’ Find files with "keyword" in name
**/*YYYY-MM-DD*.md       â†’ Find files with specific date format
Research/**/*.md          â†’ Find all markdown in Research/
Work/Projects/**/*.md     â†’ Find all markdown in Work/Projects/
```

**Advanced patterns**:
```
**/{transformer,attention,neural}*.md  â†’ Multiple keywords
**/*2025-10*.md                        â†’ October 2025 files
**/*.{md,txt}                          â†’ Multiple extensions
```

**Date-based search**:
```bash
# Files modified in last 7 days
find . -name "*.md" -mtime -7

# Files modified in October 2025
find . -name "*2025-10*.md"
```

**Advantages**:
- Direct filename matching
- Fast execution
- Good for date/name patterns

**Limitations**:
- Only searches filenames
- Misses content matches
- Requires knowing naming conventions

### Deep Content Search

**Grep search**:
```bash
# Basic content search
grep -r "keyword" . --include="*.md"

# Case-insensitive
grep -ri "keyword" . --include="*.md"

# Multiple keywords (OR)
grep -rE "keyword1|keyword2" . --include="*.md"

# With context lines
grep -r "keyword" . --include="*.md" -A 2 -B 2
```

**Task subagent for complex searches**:
```
User: "Find all notes about transformers that mention attention mechanism and were created in the last month"

â†’ Too complex for single grep
â†’ Invoke Task subagent:
  1. Grep for "transformer"
  2. Filter results by "attention mechanism"
  3. Filter by date (last month)
  4. Return consolidated results
```

**Advantages**:
- Comprehensive text search
- Finds content regardless of location
- Good for forgotten file locations

**Limitations**:
- Slower than other methods
- May return too many results
- High context consumption (use Task subagent for complex cases)

## Search Optimization

### Start Specific, Expand if Needed

**Progression**:
1. Try structured navigation first (if logical directory exists)
2. If no results: try pattern search
3. If still no results: try deep content search
4. If still nothing: suggest broader keywords or check Archive/

**Example**:
```
Query: "Find transformer notes"

1. Structured: Check Research/AI/README.md â†’ Found 2 files âœ…
2. Pattern: Not needed (found with structured)
3. Content: Not needed

vs.

Query: "Find notes about neural attention"

1. Structured: Check Research/AI/README.md â†’ No exact match
2. Pattern: **/*attention*.md â†’ Found 1 file
3. Content: grep "neural attention" â†’ Found 3 more files
4. Combined results, ranked by relevance
```

### Use README.md as Primary Index

**README.md advantages**:
- Curated by user (most important files listed)
- Includes descriptions (better context)
- Organized logically (related files grouped)
- Faster than filesystem traversal

**Always check README.md first** before deep searches.

### Minimize Context Consumption

**For simple searches**:
- Use Glob/Grep directly
- Return results without reading full files
- Only read files user wants to open

**For complex searches**:
- Use Task subagent to handle complexity
- Subagent consumes context, not main agent
- Return only summarized results to user

## Error Handling

### No Results Found
```
Query: "Find transformer notes"
â†’ No matches in any strategy

â†’ Response:
"I couldn't find notes about transformers.

Suggestions:
- Try broader keywords (AI, neural networks)
- Search in Archive/ for old content
- Check if files use different terminology
- Create new note if content doesn't exist"
```

### Too Many Results
```
Query: "Find notes"
â†’ Returns 500+ matches

â†’ Response:
"Found 500+ files matching 'notes'.

Please narrow your search:
- Add more specific keywords
- Specify directory (Research, Work, Personal)
- Add date filter (from last week, October, etc.)
- Provide more context about what you're looking for"
```

### Ambiguous Query
```
Query: "Find it"
â†’ Query too vague

â†’ Response:
"Could you provide more details?

What are you looking for?
- File name or topic keywords
- Approximate date or time period
- Which directory (Research, Work, etc.)
- Type of content (meeting notes, research, etc.)"
```

### Permission Denied
```
Search encounters restricted directory
RULE.md: "Access restricted"

â†’ Skip directory in results
â†’ Note: "Some directories were excluded due to access restrictions"
```

## Integration with Governance

This Skill respects directory governance:

**Before searching**:
- Check RULE.md for search permissions
- Respect access restrictions
- Note privacy constraints

**During search**:
- Skip restricted directories
- Follow governance rules
- Maintain confidentiality

**In results**:
- Only show accessible files
- Note if restricted areas skipped
- Respect RULE.md read permissions

## Examples

### Example 1: Topic Search

**User**: "Where are my transformer architecture notes?"

**Skill workflow**:
1. Analyzes query â†’ Topic: transformer architecture
2. Chooses structured navigation (research topic)
3. Reads root README.md â†’ Finds Research/
4. Reads Research/README.md â†’ Finds AI/
5. Reads Research/AI/README.md
6. Finds 2 matches:
   - transformer-architecture.md (3 days ago)
   - transformer-applications.md (2 weeks ago)
7. Ranks by recency
8. Presents results with descriptions

### Example 2: Date-Based Search

**User**: "Find my meeting notes from last week"

**Skill workflow**:
1. Analyzes query â†’ Category: meetings, Date: last week
2. Chooses structured navigation + date filter
3. Reads root README.md â†’ Finds Work/
4. Reads Work/README.md â†’ Finds Meetings/
5. Reads Work/Meetings/README.md
6. Filters entries by date (last 7 days)
7. Finds 3 meetings
8. Presents chronologically

### Example 3: Content Search

**User**: "Search for 'attention mechanism' in my notes"

**Skill workflow**:
1. Analyzes query â†’ Content search, keyword: "attention mechanism"
2. Chooses deep content search
3. Executes: `grep -ri "attention mechanism" . --include="*.md"`
4. Finds 5 matches across 3 files
5. Extracts context snippets
6. Checks RULE.md permissions for each file
7. Ranks by relevance (match count + recency)
8. Presents with context snippets

## Best Practices

1. **Start with structured navigation** - Fastest and most relevant
2. **Use README.md indexes** - Curated by user, most important
3. **Minimize context** - Don't read files unless needed
4. **Rank results meaningfully** - Relevance + recency + location
5. **Provide context** - Show why files matched
6. **Offer follow-up** - Help user refine search
7. **Respect governance** - Check RULE.md permissions
8. **Handle edge cases** - No results, too many results, ambiguous queries

## Notes

- Leverages README.md indexes for curated navigation
- Uses multiple search strategies for comprehensive coverage
- Respects RULE.md governance and access restrictions
- Minimizes context consumption with Task subagent for complex searches
- Works in parallel with CLAUDE.md subagents independently
