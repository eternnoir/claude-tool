# Add Content Skill

Generic file creation Skill that works with any directory structure by reading RULE.md to understand purpose and rules.

## When to use this Skill

- User says "save", "create", "add", "note", "記錄", "筆記"
- User provides content to store
- User provides URLs to archive
- User mentions "readlater", "bookmark", "save article"
- User requests content preservation

## Workflow

### 1. Content Analysis

**Determine content type**:
- URL: Web content to archive
- Text: Note or article
- Code: Code snippet
- Structured data: JSON, YAML, etc.
- Mixed: Multiple content types

**Extract key information**:
- Main topics and themes
- Keywords and technical terms
- Content category (technical, personal, work, etc.)
- Content length and complexity

### 2. Directory Discovery

**Scan knowledge base**:
1. Identify root directory (current working directory or user-specified)
2. List main directories using `ls` or Glob
3. Read RULE.md from each main directory
4. Build directory catalog with purposes

**Example scan result**:
```
ReadLater/ - Purpose: "Archive web content for later reading"
Research/ - Purpose: "Technical and academic research notes"
Work/ - Purpose: "Professional work-related content"
Personal/ - Purpose: "Personal life documentation"
Miscellaneous/ - Purpose: "General notes and articles"
```

### 3. Smart Classification

**Match content to directories**:
1. Analyze content topics vs directory purposes
2. Check if content type matches directory specialization
3. Consider user's past behavior (if known)
4. Rank directories by suitability (0-100 score)

**Classification logic**:
- URL + directory purpose mentions "web archival" → high score
- Technical content + directory purpose mentions "research" → high score
- Work keywords + directory purpose mentions "professional" → high score
- Default to "Miscellaneous" or similar general-purpose directory

### 4. User Confirmation

**Present recommendation**:
```
I analyzed your content about [topic].

Recommended location: [Directory]/
Reason: [Why this directory suits the content]

Is this correct?
- Yes (proceed with this directory)
- No, use different directory (please specify path)
- Show me other options
```

**If user requests alternatives**:
- Show top 3 ranked directories with scores and reasons
- Allow user to choose or specify custom path

**If user specifies custom path**:
- Validate path exists or create if requested
- Continue with specified path

### 5. Read Target RULE.md

**Locate and read RULE.md**:
1. Check target directory for RULE.md
2. If not found, check parent directories (inheritance)
3. If no RULE.md found, ask user if should create one

**Parse RULE.md for**:
- File naming conventions (e.g., `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`)
- Required file structure (e.g., directories, metadata files)
- Frontmatter requirements (if any)
- Special instructions (e.g., "fetch from URL", "generate summary")
- Business logic workflows (e.g., web archival process)
- Format examples

### 6. Execute Operation Per RULE.md

**Follow RULE.md instructions exactly**:

**Example 1 - Simple Note**:
```
RULE.md says: "Files named YYYY-MM-DD-title.md with markdown format"
→ Generate filename: 2025-10-28-transformer-architecture.md
→ Create file with content
→ Save in target directory
```

**Example 2 - Web Archival**:
```
RULE.md says:
"When user provides URL:
1. Fetch content using WebFetch
2. Convert to markdown
3. Create directory: Articles/YYYY/MM/YYYY-MM-DD_title-slug/
4. Save article.md and metadata.yaml"

→ Execute WebFetch on URL
→ Extract title, content, date
→ Convert to clean markdown
→ Create directory structure
→ Save article.md with content
→ Create metadata.yaml with:
  - url: [original URL]
  - title: [article title]
  - date: [fetch date]
  - summary: [brief summary]
→ Optionally save images if referenced
```

**Example 3 - Structured Content (WorkLog)**:
```
RULE.md says:
"Daily logs in YYYY/QX/MM-Month/ structure.
MUST verify datetime first.
Format: [specific template shown in RULE.md]"

→ Execute `date` command to verify current date
→ Parse date: 2025-10-28 → 2025/Q4/10-October/
→ Check if directory structure exists, create if needed
→ Read RULE.md template section
→ Create/update 2025-10-28.md with template format
→ Fill in sections per RULE.md specifications
```

**Key principles**:
- Execute special instructions literally (e.g., "fetch from URL")
- Follow naming conventions exactly
- Create directories as specified
- Include required metadata/frontmatter
- Apply format examples shown in RULE.md

### 7. Governance Update

**Update README.md**:
1. Read current README.md in target directory
2. Find appropriate section (Files, Subdirectories, etc.)
3. Add new entry with:
   - Filename with link
   - Brief description (from content analysis or user input)
   - Timestamp: current date
4. Update "Recent Changes" section
5. Update "Last updated" timestamp
6. Save README.md

**Update parent README.md if needed**:
- If created new subdirectory, update parent's README.md
- Add entry for new subdirectory with description

**Verify updates**:
- Check README.md is valid markdown
- Ensure no duplicate entries
- Confirm timestamps are current

### 8. Report to User

**Confirm operation complete**:
```
✅ Content created successfully

Location: [full path to file]
Format: [file format used]
Governance: [which RULE.md applied]

README.md updated:
- [target directory]/README.md
- [parent directory]/README.md (if applicable)

Summary:
[Brief summary of what was created and where]
```

## Special Cases

### URL Content Archival

When content is URL and RULE.md specifies archival:

1. **Validate URL**:
   - Check URL format is valid
   - Optionally test if URL is accessible

2. **Check for Duplicates**:
   - Search existing README.md for this URL
   - If found: warn user, ask if should re-archive

3. **Fetch Content**:
   - Use WebFetch tool with prompt: "Extract the main article content, title, and publication date"
   - Handle fetch errors gracefully

4. **Process Content**:
   - Convert HTML to clean markdown
   - Extract images if RULE.md requests
   - Generate title slug for directory name
   - Create brief summary (2-3 sentences)

5. **Save Per RULE.md**:
   - Follow directory structure exactly
   - Create all specified files
   - Include all required metadata

### Structured Content with Frontmatter

If RULE.md requires YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: [Title]
date: [Date]
tags: [tag1, tag2]
category: [Category]
---

[Content here]
```

Generate frontmatter with:
- Required fields per RULE.md
- Inferred values from content analysis
- User-provided metadata if available

### Multiple Files

If RULE.md specifies creating multiple files:

1. Create all files in specified order
2. Ensure cross-references are correct
3. Update README.md to list all created files
4. Report all files created

### Custom Business Logic in RULE.md

Parse RULE.md for custom instructions:

**Pattern detection**:
- "When user provides URL..." → URL handling logic
- "When user mentions [keyword]..." → Keyword-triggered workflow
- "MUST verify [condition]" → Mandatory pre-check
- "After creation, [action]" → Post-creation hook

**Execute custom logic**:
- Follow instructions step-by-step
- Use specified tools (WebFetch, Bash, etc.)
- Maintain specified format
- Report custom workflow execution

## Error Handling

### No Suitable Directory Found
- Ask user: "I couldn't find a suitable directory. Please specify where to save this content, or I can help you create a new directory."
- Offer to create new directory with RULE.md

### RULE.md Missing
- Check parent directories for inheritance
- If no RULE.md in tree: ask user if should create one
- Fallback: use basic file creation with sensible defaults

### Ambiguous Classification
- Present multiple options with scores
- Explain reasoning for each
- Let user choose or specify custom path

### RULE.md Instructions Unclear
- Ask user for clarification
- Offer to interpret instructions and ask for confirmation
- Document unclear instructions for future improvement

### File Already Exists
- Check if filename conflicts with existing file
- Offer to: append timestamp, rename, overwrite, or choose different name
- Never overwrite without confirmation

### Operation Fails
- Report error clearly
- Explain what went wrong
- Suggest alternatives or fixes
- Don't leave partial state (clean up if needed)

## Integration with Governance

This Skill automatically invokes the governance protocol:

**Before operation**:
- Locate and read RULE.md
- Validate operation is allowed
- Check README.md for context

**During operation**:
- Follow RULE.md specifications
- Execute any special workflows

**After operation**:
- Update README.md
- Update parent README.md if needed
- Verify updates successful

## Examples

### Example 1: Simple Note

**User**: "Save this note: Today I learned about transformer architecture in deep learning"

**Skill workflow**:
1. Analyzes content → Technical/AI topic
2. Scans directories → Finds Research/AI/, Research/DeepLearning/, Miscellaneous/
3. Reads RULE.md files → Research/AI/ purpose: "AI and machine learning research"
4. Recommends Research/AI/ (score: 95)
5. User confirms
6. Reads Research/AI/RULE.md → Files named `YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md`
7. Creates `2025-10-28-transformer-architecture.md`
8. Updates Research/AI/README.md
9. Reports success with file location

### Example 2: Web Archival

**User**: "readlater https://example.com/interesting-article"

**Skill workflow**:
1. Detects URL
2. Scans directories → Finds ReadLater/
3. Reads ReadLater/RULE.md → Purpose: "Archive web content"
   - Instructions: "Fetch URL, convert to markdown, save in Articles/YYYY/MM/"
4. Recommends ReadLater/ (score: 100, exact match)
5. User confirms (or auto-confirm for obvious match)
6. Executes RULE.md instructions:
   - WebFetch URL
   - Extracts title: "Interesting Article About AI"
   - Converts to markdown
   - Creates `ReadLater/Articles/2025/10/2025-10-28_interesting-article-about-ai/`
   - Saves article.md and metadata.yaml
7. Updates ReadLater/README.md and ReadLater/Articles/2025/10/README.md
8. Reports success with summary

### Example 3: WorkLog Entry

**User**: "Update my worklog"

**Skill workflow**:
1. Detects worklog keyword
2. Scans directories → Finds Work/WorkLog/
3. Reads Work/WorkLog/RULE.md:
   - Purpose: "Daily work logs"
   - Structure: YYYY/QX/MM-Month/
   - MUST verify datetime first
   - Format: [specific template]
4. Recommends Work/WorkLog/ (score: 100)
5. User confirms
6. Executes RULE.md instructions:
   - Runs `date` → 2025-10-28
   - Parses to 2025/Q4/10-October/
   - Checks if directory exists, creates if needed
   - Checks if 2025-10-28.md exists
   - Creates/updates file with template from RULE.md
7. Updates hierarchical README.md files:
   - Work/WorkLog/2025/Q4/10-October/README.md
   - Work/WorkLog/2025/Q4/README.md
   - Work/WorkLog/README.md
8. Reports success with daily log location

## Best Practices

1. **Always read RULE.md completely** - Don't assume, read the full file
2. **Ask for confirmation on ambiguous choices** - User knows their needs
3. **Follow RULE.md exactly** - It's the contract for directory behavior
4. **Update README.md immediately** - Don't batch updates
5. **Report clearly** - User should know exactly what happened
6. **Handle errors gracefully** - Don't leave broken state
7. **Preserve existing structure** - Don't modify unrelated files
8. **Document custom workflows** - If RULE.md has special instructions, note them

## Notes

- This Skill is generic - it works with ANY directory structure
- Business logic comes from RULE.md, not hardcoded in Skill
- Classification is smart but always asks for user confirmation
- RULE.md format is natural language - no strict schema required
- Integration with governance agent is automatic
- Works in parallel with CLAUDE.md subagents independently
