# AkashicRecords Plugin

**The First AI-Native Knowledge Management System**

Version: 1.0.0 | License: MIT | Author: Frank Wang

## Overview

AkashicRecords is a Claude Code plugin designed for **AI agents to autonomously manage knowledge bases**. Unlike traditional tools built for human organization, AkashicRecords enables AI to read your organizational rules, understand directory purposes, and execute complex workflows independently.

### What Makes It AI-Native?

**Traditional Approach** (Human-Centric):
```
1. Human decides where files go
2. Human manually organizes content
3. Human follows their own mental rules
4. Tools provide storage, not intelligence
```

**AkashicRecords Approach** (AI-Centric):
```
1. Human defines rules in RULE.md (once)
2. AI reads RULE.md to understand purposes
3. AI autonomously classifies and organizes
4. AI executes custom workflows automatically
5. Human confirms critical decisions only
```

### Core Philosophy

**Self-Describing Directories + AI Understanding = Autonomous Knowledge Management**

- **RULE.md files**: Directories describe their own purpose and workflows
- **AI reads and understands**: No hardcoded assumptions, AI learns from your rules
- **Generic Skills**: Universal operations that adapt to any organizational structure
- **Human-in-the-loop**: AI recommends, human confirms, ensuring control

This enables AI to:
- ðŸ“– **Understand** directory purposes by reading RULE.md
- ðŸ¤– **Execute** custom workflows defined in natural language
- ðŸŽ¯ **Classify** content by matching topics to purposes
- âœ… **Maintain** governance automatically (README.md updates, cross-references)
- ðŸ”„ **Adapt** to any organizational structure without reprogramming

## Key Features

### 1. Universal File Operations (Skills)

Five generic Skills that work with any directory structure:

- **add-content**: Create files by reading RULE.md to understand how
- **update-content**: Update files while respecting RULE.md constraints
- **delete-content**: Delete files with dependency checking and RULE.md permissions
- **move-content**: Move/rename files across directories with format adaptation
- **search-content**: Search using README.md indexes, patterns, or deep content search

### 2. RULE.md-Driven Business Logic

Each directory can have a `RULE.md` file specifying:
- Directory purpose (e.g., "for web content archival")
- File naming conventions
- Required file formats
- Special instructions for Claude (e.g., "fetch from URL and convert to markdown")
- Allowed operations and constraints

Skills read RULE.md and execute accordingly - **no hardcoded assumptions**.

### 3. Smart Classification with Confirmation

When creating content, Skills:
1. Analyze content to understand topic/type
2. Read RULE.md of multiple directories to understand purposes
3. Recommend most suitable directory based on matching
4. Ask user for confirmation before proceeding
5. Execute per target directory's RULE.md specifications

### 4. Directory Governance

- Automatic README.md updating after every operation
- RULE.md compliance checking before operations
- Directory structure validation and maintenance
- Cross-reference tracking and broken link detection

### 5. Management Commands

- `/akashic-init`: Initialize governance for directory tree
- `/akashic-maintain`: Validate and fix governance issues

## How It Works

### The RULE.md Contract

Each directory's `RULE.md` defines behavior. Here's how it enables universal workflows:

#### Example 1: Web Content Archival

**Your ReadLater/RULE.md says:**
```markdown
# ReadLater Directory

## Purpose
This directory stores archived web content for later reading.

## When Claude detects URLs or "readlater" keyword:
1. Use WebFetch to retrieve content
2. Convert HTML to clean markdown
3. Create directory: Articles/YYYY/MM/YYYY-MM-DD_title-slug/
4. Save article.md with content
5. Create metadata.yaml with URL, title, date, summary
6. Update README.md

## File Structure
Articles/
â””â”€â”€ YYYY/
    â””â”€â”€ MM/
        â””â”€â”€ YYYY-MM-DD_title-slug/
            â”œâ”€â”€ article.md
            â”œâ”€â”€ metadata.yaml
            â””â”€â”€ images/ (optional)
```

**When you say:** "readlater https://example.com/article"

**add-content Skill:**
1. Detects URL in request
2. Scans directories and reads their RULE.md files
3. Sees ReadLater/RULE.md mentions "web content archival"
4. Recommends ReadLater/ directory
5. Reads ReadLater/RULE.md for detailed instructions
6. Executes workflow exactly as specified:
   - Fetches URL with WebFetch
   - Converts to markdown
   - Creates directory structure
   - Saves article.md and metadata.yaml
7. Updates README.md
8. Reports completion

**Result:** Business logic executed, but defined by YOUR RULE.md, not hardcoded in plugin!

#### Example 2: Daily Work Logs

**Your Work/WorkLog/RULE.md says:**
```markdown
# WorkLog Directory

## Purpose
Daily work logs with meetings, tasks, and time tracking.

## Structure
YYYY/
â””â”€â”€ QX/
    â””â”€â”€ MM-Month/
        â””â”€â”€ YYYY-MM-DD.md

## When Claude processes worklog requests:
1. MUST verify current datetime first (run `date` command)
2. Parse date to determine: YYYY/QX/MM-Month/ path
3. Check if directory structure exists, create if needed
4. Create/update YYYY-MM-DD.md with this format:

   # Work Log - YYYY-MM-DD (Day of Week)

   ## Meetings
   - [Time] Meeting name (Duration)

   ## Priority Tasks
   ### High Priority
   - [ ] Task description

   ### Medium Priority
   - [ ] Task description

   ## Time Slots
   ...

5. Update hierarchical README.md files:
   - Day file README
   - Month directory README
   - Quarter directory README
   - Main WorkLog README
```

**When you say:** "Update my worklog"

**add-content Skill:**
1. Analyzes request - worklog keyword detected
2. Scans directories, finds Work/WorkLog/
3. Reads Work/WorkLog/RULE.md
4. Sees worklog instructions
5. Executes per RULE.md:
   - Runs `date` command â†’ 2025-10-28
   - Parses to 2025/Q4/10-October/
   - Checks if directory exists, creates if needed
   - Creates/updates 2025-10-28.md with template format
   - Updates all README.md files in hierarchy
6. Reports completion with daily log location

**Result:** WorkLog workflow executed based on your RULE.md specifications!

### Why This Design Works

#### For Any Directory Structure

You're not limited to predefined directories like `ReadLater/` or `Research/`. You define:
- Your own directory names
- Your own purposes in RULE.md
- Your own workflows
- Your own file formats

Skills adapt automatically by reading your RULE.md files.

#### For Different Use Cases

**Academic Research:**
```
Research/
â”œâ”€â”€ RULE.md (Purpose: "Academic papers and research notes")
â”œâ”€â”€ Papers/
â”œâ”€â”€ Experiments/
â””â”€â”€ Literature/
```

**Project Management:**
```
Projects/
â”œâ”€â”€ RULE.md (Purpose: "Active projects with specs and docs")
â”œâ”€â”€ ProjectA/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ RULE.md (Purpose: "Project A materials, requires frontmatter")
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ specs.md
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ docs/
â””â”€â”€ ProjectB/
```

**Personal Journaling:**
```
Journal/
â”œâ”€â”€ RULE.md (Purpose: "Daily journal entries, date-based naming")
â”œâ”€â”€ 2025/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 01-January/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ 02-February/
```

Skills work with all of these because they read RULE.md to understand behavior!

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Claude Code v1.0 or later
- Basic familiarity with markdown and directory structure

### Install from Marketplace

```bash
# Add claude-tools marketplace
/plugin marketplace add /path/to/claude-tool

# Or if using Git repository
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/eternnoir/claude-tool

# Install akashicrecords plugin
/plugin install akashicrecords@claude-tools
```

### Verify Installation

After installation, check available commands:
```bash
/help
```

You should see `/akashic-init` and `/akashic-maintain` in the commands list.

## Quick Start

### 1. Initialize Your Directory

Navigate to your knowledge base directory and initialize governance:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/knowledge-base
claude
```

```
/akashic-init
```

This will:
- Scan your directory structure
- Create initial RULE.md files (or inherit from parent)
- Generate README.md indexes for all directories
- Set up governance tracking

### 2. Define Directory Purposes

Edit RULE.md files to define what each directory is for:

**Example - Research/RULE.md:**
```markdown
# Research Directory

## Purpose
Technical and academic research notes, papers, and experiments.

## File Naming
Files should be named: YYYY-MM-DD-topic-name.md

## Format
Markdown files with optional YAML frontmatter:
---
title: [Title]
date: [Date]
tags: [tag1, tag2]
---

## Allowed Operations
- Create: Yes
- Update: Yes
- Delete: Yes (with confirmation)
- Move: Yes (to Archive/ for old content)
```

### 3. Start Using Skills

Skills activate automatically based on your requests:

**Add content:**
```
User: "Save this note about transformers in AI"
â†’ add-content Skill activates
â†’ Analyzes content (AI topic)
â†’ Recommends Research/AI/ based on RULE.md
â†’ Creates file per RULE.md format
â†’ Updates README.md
```

**Search content:**
```
User: "Where are my transformer notes?"
â†’ search-content Skill activates
â†’ Searches using README.md indexes and patterns
â†’ Returns matching files with descriptions
```

**Update content:**
```
User: "Update the transformer architecture note"
â†’ update-content Skill activates
â†’ Finds file
â†’ Checks RULE.md for update rules
â†’ Applies changes while maintaining format
â†’ Updates README.md timestamp
```

That's it! Skills work automatically based on your requests and RULE.md specifications.

## Skills Reference

## RULE.md Guide

### Purpose

RULE.md defines how a directory behaves. It's the contract between your knowledge organization and the Skills.

### Format

Use natural language markdown (no strict schema required):

```markdown
# Directory Name

## Purpose
[What this directory is for]

## File Naming Convention
[How files should be named]

## Structure
[Directory structure and organization]

## Special Instructions
[Custom workflows or processes]

## Allowed Operations
[What operations are permitted]
```

### Examples

#### Simple Directory

```markdown
# Meeting Notes

## Purpose
Store meeting notes and minutes.

## File Naming
Files named: YYYY-MM-DD-meeting-topic.md

## Allowed Operations
Create, update, delete with confirmation.
```

#### Advanced with Custom Workflow

```markdown
# ReadLater - Web Content Archive

## Purpose
Archive web content for later reading with full text and metadata.

## Structure
Articles/YYYY/MM/YYYY-MM-DD_title-slug/
â”œâ”€â”€ article.md (main content)
â”œâ”€â”€ metadata.yaml (URL, title, date, summary)
â””â”€â”€ images/ (optional)

## When Claude detects URLs or "readlater" keyword:
1. Use WebFetch tool to retrieve content
2. Extract title, clean content, publication date
3. Convert HTML to clean markdown
4. Generate 2-3 sentence summary
5. Create directory: Articles/YYYY/MM/YYYY-MM-DD_title-slug/
6. Save article.md with content
7. Create metadata.yaml with:
   ```yaml
   url: [original URL]
   title: [article title]
   date_archived: [date]
   summary: [brief summary]
   tags: [auto-generated or user-specified]
   ```
8. Update README.md in Articles/, Articles/YYYY/, Articles/YYYY/MM/

## Allowed Operations
- Create: Yes (via web archival workflow)
- Update: Metadata only (preserve original content)
- Delete: Move to Archive/ instead of permanent deletion
- Move: To Archive/ for content >1 year old
```

#### Directory with Format Requirements

```markdown
# Research Papers

## Purpose
Academic research papers and notes with citations.

## File Format
Markdown with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: [Paper title]
authors: [Author list]
date: [Publication date]
tags: [topic tags]
citations: [BibTeX keys]
---
```

## File Naming
author-year-short-title.md

Example: smith-2023-transformer-architecture.md

## Allowed Operations
- Create: Yes (must include frontmatter)
- Update: Yes (preserve frontmatter fields)
- Delete: Requires approval (check citations)
```

### RULE.md Inheritance

If a directory doesn't have RULE.md, it inherits from parent:

```
Root/
â”œâ”€â”€ RULE.md (base rules)
â”œâ”€â”€ Research/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ RULE.md (research-specific, overrides root)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ AI/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ RULE.md (AI-specific, overrides Research)
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ papers/
â”‚   â”‚       â””â”€â”€ (inherits from AI/RULE.md)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Physics/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ (inherits from Research/RULE.md)
â””â”€â”€ Work/
    â”œâ”€â”€ RULE.md (work-specific)
    â””â”€â”€ Projects/
        â””â”€â”€ (inherits from Work/RULE.md)
```

Skills traverse up the tree to find applicable RULE.md.

## README.md Maintenance

README.md files serve as directory indexes and are automatically updated by Skills.

### Format Example

```markdown
# Directory Name

## Overview
Brief description of directory contents and purpose.

## Contents

### Files
- [file1.md](file1.md) - Description (Last updated: 2025-10-28)
- [file2.md](file2.md) - Description (Last updated: 2025-10-25)
- [file3.md](file3.md) - Description (Last updated: 2025-10-20)

### Subdirectories
- [subdirectory/](subdirectory/) - Description

## Recent Changes
- 2025-10-28: Added file3.md
- 2025-10-25: Updated file2.md
- 2025-10-20: Created subdirectory/

Last updated: 2025-10-28
```

### Automatic Updates

Skills automatically update README.md:
- **After add-content**: Add new file entry
- **After update-content**: Update modification timestamp
- **After delete-content**: Remove file entry, add to "Recent Changes"
- **After move-content**: Remove from source, add to target README.md

## Troubleshooting

### Skills Not Activating

**Symptom**: You request an operation but Skill doesn't trigger.

**Solutions**:
1. Use more explicit trigger words:
   - For add: "save", "create", "add"
   - For search: "find", "where is", "search for"
   - For update: "update", "edit", "modify"
2. Check if request is ambiguous - be more specific
3. Try natural phrasing: "I want to save this note about [topic]"

### Classification Recommendations Off

**Symptom**: add-content recommends wrong directory.

**Solutions**:
1. Check RULE.md in target directories - purposes should be clear
2. Manually specify directory: "Save this to Research/AI/"
3. Update RULE.md to better describe directory purpose
4. Add keywords to RULE.md that match your content type

### RULE.md Not Being Followed

**Symptom**: Skills don't follow RULE.md instructions.

**Solutions**:
1. Check RULE.md format - ensure it's clear markdown
2. Use explicit instructions: "When Claude [detects X], do [Y]"
3. Provide examples in RULE.md
4. Test with simple instructions first, then add complexity

### README.md Out of Date

**Symptom**: README.md doesn't reflect current directory state.

**Solution**:
```
/akashic-maintain
```

This will:
- Detect outdated README.md files
- Identify missing entries
- Offer to regenerate
- Update all README.md files

### Cross-References Broken

**Symptom**: Files link to moved/deleted content.

**Solution**:
Use delete-content or move-content Skills - they automatically:
- Detect cross-references
- Warn about broken links
- Offer to update references
- Fix links automatically (with confirmation)

### Governance Violations

**Symptom**: Operations fail due to RULE.md restrictions.

**Solutions**:
1. Read RULE.md to understand restriction
2. Either:
   - Follow RULE.md requirements
   - Or explicitly override (Skills will ask for confirmation)
3. Update RULE.md if rule is outdated

## Best Practices

### 1. Write Clear RULE.md Files

**Good RULE.md**:
```markdown
# Research Notes

## Purpose
Technical research notes on AI, machine learning, and software engineering.
When user saves notes about these topics, recommend this directory.

## File Naming
YYYY-MM-DD-topic-keywords.md

Examples:
- 2025-10-28-transformer-architecture.md
- 2025-10-25-neural-networks-intro.md

## When to Use This Directory
- Academic research content
- Technical deep-dives
- Paper summaries
- Experiment notes
```

**Vague RULE.md** (avoid):
```markdown
# Research

For research stuff.
```

### 2. Maintain One Level of RULE.md

Don't over-specify. Use inheritance:

**Good structure**:
```
Research/
â”œâ”€â”€ RULE.md (research-wide rules)
â”œâ”€â”€ AI/ (inherits from Research)
â”œâ”€â”€ Physics/ (inherits from Research)
â””â”€â”€ Biology/ (inherits from Research)
```

**Over-specified** (avoid):
```
Research/
â”œâ”€â”€ RULE.md
â”œâ”€â”€ AI/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ RULE.md (mostly duplicates parent)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ DeepLearning/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ RULE.md (mostly duplicates parent)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ NLP/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ RULE.md (mostly duplicates parent)
```

### 3. Run Periodic Maintenance

Monthly maintenance keeps governance healthy:

```bash
# Last day of month
/akashic-maintain
```

This catches:
- README.md drift
- Orphaned files
- Governance violations
- Inheritance issues

### 4. Let Skills Recommend, Then Confirm

Don't pre-decide where content goes. Let Skills recommend:

**Good workflow**:
```
User: "Save this note about transformers"
Skill: "I recommend Research/AI/ - this looks like AI research. Confirm?"
User: "Yes" (or "No, use Work/Projects/ instead")
```

**Less optimal**:
```
User: "Save this to Research/AI/2025-10-28-transformers.md with frontmatter..."
(Bypasses intelligent classification and recommendation)
```

### 5. Use Natural Language

Skills understand natural requests:

**Natural** (good):
```
"Save this article for later"
"Find my notes about transformers"
"Update the architecture document"
"Move old research to archive"
```

**Over-specified** (unnecessary):
```
"/add-content --target=Research/AI/ --format=markdown --frontmatter=yes"
(Skills handle this automatically)
```

### 6. Trust README.md Indexes

README.md files are your curated navigation:
- Search consults README.md first (fastest, most relevant)
- Add/Update/Delete maintain README.md automatically
- Trust README.md as source of truth for directory contents

## Integration with CLAUDE.md

### Parallel Operation

This plugin works in parallel with CLAUDE.md subagents:
- Plugin Skills can activate based on user requests
- CLAUDE.md subagents can also activate for same requests
- Both use governance protocol (read RULE.md, update README.md)
- Whichever has higher match confidence triggers first

**No conflict** - both systems respect same governance rules.

### When to Use Plugin vs CLAUDE.md

**Use plugin Skills when**:
- You want explicit file operations
- You need generic workflows
- Working with any directory structure

**CLAUDE.md subagents provide**:
- Business-specific logic beyond file operations
- Complex multi-step workflows
- Custom classification algorithms

**Best practice**: Install plugin for convenience, keep CLAUDE.md for custom logic. They complement each other.

## Examples

## FAQ

### Q: Do I need specific directory names like "ReadLater" or "Research"?

**A**: No! You define your own directory names. Skills read RULE.md to understand purpose, not directory names.

### Q: Can Skills handle complex workflows like web archival?

**A**: Yes! Put workflow instructions in RULE.md. Skills read and execute them. For example, RULE.md can say "when URL detected, fetch with WebFetch, convert to markdown, save in specific structure" - Skills will follow exactly.

### Q: What if I don't want to write RULE.md files?

**A**: Skills work with minimal RULE.md. Even a simple "Purpose: [description]" is helpful. Or use inheritance - write RULE.md at root, subdirectories inherit.

### Q: How do Skills choose where to save content?

**A**: Skills:
1. Analyze content (topic, type)
2. Read RULE.md of multiple directories
3. Match content to directory purposes
4. Recommend best match
5. Always ask for your confirmation

### Q: Can I use this with my existing knowledge base?

**A**: Yes! Run `/akashic-init` to add governance to existing directories. It won't change your files, just adds RULE.md and README.md for governance.

### Q: What happens if RULE.md conflicts with my request?

**A**: Skills will warn you and explain the conflict. You can either:
- Follow RULE.md guidelines
- Override the rule (Skills will ask for confirmation)

### Q: Do Skills work without README.md?

**A**: Yes, but README.md makes search faster and more accurate. Run `/akashic-maintain` to generate missing README.md files.

### Q: Can I customize how Skills behave?

**A**: Yes! Write custom workflows in RULE.md. Skills execute what RULE.md specifies. You control behavior through RULE.md, not by modifying plugin.

### Q: How do I update the plugin?

**A**: Reinstall from marketplace:
```
/plugin uninstall akashicrecords@claude-tools
/plugin install akashicrecords@claude-tools
```

Your RULE.md and README.md files are preserved (plugin doesn't touch your data).
