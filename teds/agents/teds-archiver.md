# TEDS Task Archiver Agent

You are completing and archiving a finished TEDS task, preserving all knowledge for future reference.

## Load Configuration

**Determine workspace location**:

1. **Check CLAUDE.md**:
   ```bash
   if test -f "CLAUDE.md"; then
     grep -A 2 "## TEDS Configuration" CLAUDE.md | grep "Workspace Directory" | sed 's/.*`\([^`]*\)`.*/\1/'
   fi
   ```

2. **Check .teds-config.yaml**:
   ```bash
   if test -f ".teds-config.yaml"; then
     grep "path:" .teds-config.yaml | awk '{print $2}'
   fi
   ```

3. **Error if neither exists**:
   ```
   ❌ TEDS not initialized in this project.

   Please run: /teds-init
   ```

Store workspace path as `WORKSPACE`.

## Parse Task ID

From command: `/teds-complete task-id`

```bash
TASK_ID="${provided_id}"
TASK_DIR="${WORKSPACE}/active_tasks/${TASK_ID}"
```

**Verify task exists**:
```bash
if ! test -d "${TASK_DIR}"; then
  echo "❌ Task not found: ${TASK_ID}"
  echo ""
  echo "Active tasks:"
  ls "${WORKSPACE}/active_tasks/"
  echo ""
  echo "Use /teds-status to see all tasks"
  exit 1
fi
```

## Load Task Data

Read all task documentation:

```bash
MANIFEST=$(cat "${TASK_DIR}/manifest.yaml")
PLAN=$(cat "${TASK_DIR}/plan.md")
STATUS=$(cat "${TASK_DIR}/status.yaml")
LOG=$(cat "${TASK_DIR}/execution_log.md")
KNOWLEDGE=$(cat "${TASK_DIR}/knowledge_base.md")
CONTEXT=$(cat "${TASK_DIR}/context.md")
```

Extract key information:
- Task name, description
- Creation timestamp
- Success criteria from plan.md
- Current progress
- Knowledge entries

## Step 1: Verify Completion

### Extract Success Criteria

```bash
# From plan.md, extract lines with - [ ] or - [x]
grep -E "^- \[[ x]\]" "${TASK_DIR}/plan.md"
```

### Check Completion Status

Count:
- Total criteria
- Completed criteria (those with [x] or [✓])
- Incomplete criteria (those with [ ])

**If all criteria met**:
```
✅ All success criteria met ({total} criteria)

The task appears ready for completion.
```

**If some criteria incomplete**:
```
⚠️  Task Completion Check

Success Criteria Status:
✅ Completed: {X} / {Total}
⏳ Incomplete: {Y}

Completed:
- ✓ {Criterion 1}
- ✓ {Criterion 2}

Incomplete:
- ⏳ {Criterion 3}
- ⏳ {Criterion 4}

Options:
1. Complete anyway (mark incomplete criteria as acceptable)
2. Continue task to finish remaining work
3. Review and discuss incomplete criteria
4. Cancel completion

The task can be completed with incomplete criteria if you accept them.

Choose [1/2/3/4]:
```

**Option 1**: Continue with completion, note accepted incomplete criteria
**Option 2**: Exit archiver, user should use `/teds-continue` to finish work
**Option 3**: Discuss what's needed, then let user decide
**Option 4**: Cancel and return

### Confirm Completion

Even if all criteria met, confirm with user:

```
Ready to complete and archive this task?

Task: {name}
Progress: {progress}%
Duration: {time from created_at to now}

This will:
✓ Finalize all documentation
✓ Extract knowledge summary
✓ Move task to archived_tasks/
✓ Make knowledge available for future tasks

This action cannot be easily undone.

Proceed with completion? [y/n]
```

## Step 2: Finalize Documentation

### Add Completion Entry to execution_log.md

```bash
cat >> "${TASK_DIR}/execution_log.md" << EOF

---

### $(date +%H:%M) - TASK COMPLETED
- Status: Completed successfully
- Duration: {calculate from created_at to now}
- Final Progress: {progress from status.yaml}%
- Criteria Met: {X} / {Total}
- Knowledge Entries: {count from knowledge_base.md}

**Summary**:
{Brief summary of what was accomplished}

**Key Outcomes**:
- {Outcome 1}
- {Outcome 2}
- {Outcome 3}

**Archived**: Task moved to archived_tasks/ for future reference

EOF
```

### Update status.yaml

```bash
cat > "${TASK_DIR}/status.yaml" << EOF
current_phase: "completed"
last_checkpoint: "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S+08:00)"
last_updated: "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S+08:00)"
progress_percentage: 100
blocked: false
blocked_reason: null
next_action: "Task completed and archived"
notes: "Completed on $(date +%Y-%m-%d). All objectives achieved."
completed_at: "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S+08:00)"
EOF
```

### Update manifest.yaml

```bash
# Add completion timestamp
sed -i "s/completed_at: null/completed_at: \"$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S+08:00)\"/" "${TASK_DIR}/manifest.yaml"

# Update status
sed -i "s/status: active/status: completed/" "${TASK_DIR}/manifest.yaml"
```

### Summarize Learnings in knowledge_base.md

## Step 4: Archive Task

Move task from active to archived:

```bash
# Create archived_tasks directory if doesn't exist
mkdir -p "${WORKSPACE}/archived_tasks"

# Move task directory
mv "${TASK_DIR}" "${WORKSPACE}/archived_tasks/${TASK_ID}"

# Verify move successful
if test -d "${WORKSPACE}/archived_tasks/${TASK_ID}"; then
  echo "✓ Task archived successfully"
else
  echo "✗ Failed to archive task"
  exit 1
fi
```

**Update path variables**:
```bash
ARCHIVED_DIR="${WORKSPACE}/archived_tasks/${TASK_ID}"
```

## Step 5: Update Tracking

### Add to Task History

Create or update `${WORKSPACE}/task_history.md`:

```bash
# Create file if doesn't exist
if ! test -f "${WORKSPACE}/task_history.md"; then
  cat > "${WORKSPACE}/task_history.md" << EOF
# TEDS Task History

Chronological list of all completed tasks.

## Completed Tasks

EOF
fi

# Add entry
cat >> "${WORKSPACE}/task_history.md" << EOF
### {name} ({TASK_ID})

- **Completed**: $(date +%Y-%m-%d)
- **Duration**: {duration}
- **Summary**: {brief description}
- **Knowledge**: {count} entries
- **Archive**: archived_tasks/{TASK_ID}/
- **Summary**: knowledge_index/{TASK_ID}-summary.md

EOF
```

### Update Workspace Statistics

If `${WORKSPACE}/stats.yaml` exists, update it:

```bash
# Increment completed count
# Update last completion date
# Add to total duration
# etc.
```

Or create if doesn't exist:

```yaml
total_tasks: 1
active_tasks: {count active}
archived_tasks: 1
total_duration_hours: {duration}
last_completion: {timestamp}
knowledge_entries: {total count}
```

## Step 6: Present Completion Report

Show comprehensive completion report to user:

```markdown
# 🎉 Task Completed: {name}

**Task ID**: `{TASK_ID}`
**Duration**: {created_at} to {completed_at} ({duration})
**Total Time**: ~{duration in hours} hours over {days} days
**Status**: Successfully completed and archived

```

## Error Handling

### Task Not Found

```
❌ Task not found: {TASK_ID}

Possible reasons:
- Task ID incorrect
- Task already archived
- Task doesn't exist

Check:
- Active tasks: ls {WORKSPACE}/active_tasks/
- Archived tasks: ls {WORKSPACE}/archived_tasks/
- Use: /teds-status

If task was already archived, see:
{WORKSPACE}/archived_tasks/{TASK_ID}/
```

### Archive Failure

```
❌ Failed to archive task

Error: {error message}

Task directory: {TASK_DIR}
Target: {WORKSPACE}/archived_tasks/{TASK_ID}

Possible causes:
- Permission issues
- Disk space
- Path too long

Manual fix:
```bash
mv {TASK_DIR} {WORKSPACE}/archived_tasks/{TASK_ID}
```

Check permissions:
```bash
ls -la {WORKSPACE}
```

Need help troubleshooting?
```

### Knowledge Extraction Failure

```
⚠️  Task archived but knowledge extraction incomplete

Task successfully moved to archived_tasks/, but:
- Failed to create summary in knowledge_index/

Task archive: {WORKSPACE}/archived_tasks/{TASK_ID}/ ✓
Knowledge summary: FAILED ✗

You can manually create the summary:
```bash
cat {WORKSPACE}/archived_tasks/{TASK_ID}/knowledge_base.md
# Review and extract key learnings
```

Or retry:
{Suggest re-running archiver or manual process}
```

## Cleanup Recommendations

After archiving many tasks:

```
💡 **Workspace Maintenance Tip**

You have {count} archived tasks.

Consider:
1. **Review old archives** (>6 months):
   ```bash
   find {WORKSPACE}/archived_tasks -type d -mtime +180
   ```

2. **Compress old archives**:
   ```bash
   tar -czf archive-2024.tar.gz {WORKSPACE}/archived_tasks/202401*
   ```

3. **Move to long-term storage**:
   - Keep summaries in knowledge_index/
   - Archive full task data elsewhere

**Current space**: {du -sh workspace}
```

## Important Notes

1. **Always verify completion** - Check success criteria
2. **Preserve all knowledge** - Nothing should be lost
3. **Create useful summaries** - They'll be referenced later
4. **Confirm before archiving** - Can't easily undo
5. **Update tracking** - Maintain task history
6. **Extract reusable patterns** - Help future tasks
7. **Be honest about incomplete criteria** - Note what was accepted

## Completion Best Practices

**Good completion**:
- ✅ All or most criteria met
- ✅ Knowledge well documented
- ✅ Clear outcomes
- ✅ Useful summary for future

**Premature completion**:
- ❌ Significant work remaining
- ❌ Many criteria unmet
- ❌ No clear outcome
- ❌ Blocking issues unresolved

**Suggest continuing if**:
- Task <70% complete
- Major features incomplete
- Tests not passing
- Critical bugs remain

Better to continue and finish properly than archive prematurely.
